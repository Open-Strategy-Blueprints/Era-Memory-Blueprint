"Era Memory" National Visual Archive Co-creation Initiative
— An Executable Blueprint for Building Strategic Assets

I. Core Thesis: We Are Not Collecting Photos; We Are Mining "Data Petroleum"
Asset Nature: Non-renewable, non-replicable, emotionally bonded, fully structured.

Strategic Value: A unified solution to AI's "data famine" and the tech industry's "empathy deficit."

II. Core Logic: Why This Is Your Optimal Move Now?
Breakthrough in Data Dimension: Infuses your LLMs with "historical" and "emotional" intelligence, building a cognitive moat for understanding Chinese society.

Breakthrough in Market Dimension: Zero-cost emotional entry to systematically engage and bind the underserved "sinking market" and senior demographic.

Breakthrough in Brand Dimension: Elevates "Tech for Good" into a scalable, national-level cultural heritage rescue mission, yielding policy support, public trust, and brand prestige.

III. Core Architecture: How to Start with Minimal Risk?
Model: Asset-light, platform-based, ecosystem-driven. You provide tech, traffic, and brand; a grassroots network handles collection.

Phased Roadmap:

Pilot Phase (6 months): 1-2 counties. Validate data quality and user willingness for emotional payment.

Scale Phase (1-2 years): Replicate the model, building a 10M+ image data moat.

Platform Phase (2-3 years): Mature ecosystem with data licensing, tool subscriptions, and content monetization.

Risk Mitigation: Built-in, actionable protocols for four major risks (privacy, copyright, quality, sustainability), leveraging your existing capabilities.

IV. Your Returns: Beyond Commerce
Tangible: Exclusive data assets, new user base, revenue streams.

Intangible: Define the "AI + Culture" standard, secure top-level policy endorsement, achieve flagship ESG impact.

V. Next Steps (Low-Barrier Validation)
Form a joint task force.

Select one pilot county.

Develop a lightweight collection tool based on your existing tech (e.g., video editing apps, mini-programs).

Launch a small-scale experiment to validate core hypotheses within 6 months.

Conclusion: This blueprint designs a foreseeable future. It awaits not just funding, but conviction. It awaits a leader to coalesce scattered starlight of an era into the energy that drives tomorrow.
